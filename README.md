# 📚 README: Artificial Neural Network (ANN) & Data Preprocessing Notebooks

Welcome to this repository! Inside, you'll find two Jupyter notebooks 🐍📓 that guide you through preprocessing your data and implementing an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) 🤖.

## 📂 Files Included

### 1. `ANN.ipynb` 🤖🧠
This notebook focuses on building and training an Artificial Neural Network for your machine learning tasks. Key highlights:  
- **Model Architecture** 🏗️: Defines the input, hidden, and output layers.  
- **Compilation & Training** 🏃‍♂️: Demonstrates how to compile the model using optimizers, loss functions, and metrics.  
- **Evaluation** 📊: Provides tools to assess model performance on test data.  
- **Visualization** 📈🎨: Plots training history and performance metrics.

**🛠️ Requirements**:  
- TensorFlow/Keras  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  

💡 *Usage*: Open the notebook, ensure required libraries are installed, and follow along step-by-step!

### 2. `data_preprocessing.ipynb` 🧹📊  
This notebook prepares your dataset for machine learning. It includes:  
- **Data Cleaning** 🧼: Handling missing values, duplicates, and noisy data.  
- **Feature Scaling** ⚖️: Ensures that data is normalized for optimal model performance.  
- **Encoding** 🔤: Converts categorical data into numerical formats (e.g., one-hot encoding).  
- **Dataset Splitting** ✂️: Divides the data into training and testing subsets.  

**🛠️ Requirements**:  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  

💡 *Usage*: Run this notebook before training your model to ensure your data is clean and ready to go.
